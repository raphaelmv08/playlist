   <p> Day and night (what, what)<br>
I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind (what, what)<br>
I look for peace, but see I don't attain (what, what)<br>
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play<br>
<br>
Now look at this (what, what)<br>
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)<br>
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast (what, what)<br>
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last<br>
<br>
Cause day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)<br>
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night<br>
<br>
Day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)<br>
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)<br>
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night<br>
<br>
Hold the phone (what, what)<br>
The lonely stoner, mister solo do-lo (what, what)<br>
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade (what, what)<br>
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made<br>
<br>
The pain is deep (what, what)<br>
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)<br>
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (what, what)<br>
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through<br>
<br>
Cause day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)<br>
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night<br>
<br>
Day and night (day and night)<br>
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)<br>
He's all alone, some things will never change (yeah) (never change)<br>
The lonely loner seems to free his mind (yeah) at night, a-a-at (yeah) night<br>
<br>
Slow mo (what, what)<br>
When the tempo slows up and creates that new new (what, what)<br>
He seems alive, though he is feelin' blue (what, what)<br>
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool<br>
<br>
The lonely nights (what, what)<br>
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes (what, what)<br>
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way (what, what)<br>
To free his mind in search of<br>
To free his mind in search of<br>
To free his mind in search of<br>
