Love's gonna get you killed <br>
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me <br>
And you and you and you and me <br>
And you and you and you and me <br>
And you and you and you and me and— <br>
<br>

Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care <br>
In another life, I surely was there <br>
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care <br>
I care, I care <br>
<br>
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions <br>
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen? <br>
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em <br>
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question? <br>
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world <br>
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world <br>
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man <br>
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band <br>
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around <br>
This time I might put you down <br>
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now <br>
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb <br>
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from <br>
Pity parties and functions of you and yours <br>
A perfect world, you probably live another 24 <br>
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure <br>
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure <br>
<br>
Me, I wasn’t taught to share, but care <br>
In another life, I surely was there <br>
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care <br>
I care, I care <br>
<br>
Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there <br>
<br>

Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive <br>
Cold as December but never remember what winter did <br>
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid <br>
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays <br>
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there <br>
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here <br>
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back <br>
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that <br>
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride <br>
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies <br>
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive <br>
Race barriers make inferior of you and I <br>
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches <br>
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison <br>
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service <br>
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world <br>
<br>
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care <br>
In another life, I surely was there <br>
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care <br>
I care, I care <br>
<br>

Maybe I wasn't there (We saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there (I saw you first) <br>
Maybe I wasn't there    <br>
