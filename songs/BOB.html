        One, two<br>
One, two, three, yeah!<br>
<br>
Inslumnational, underground<br>
Thunder pounds when I stomp the ground (Woo!)<br>
Like a million elephants or silverback orangutans<br>
You can't stop the train<br>
Who want some? Don't come unprepared<br>
I'll be there, but when I leave there<br>
Better be a household name<br>
Weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain<br>
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet<br>
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat<br>
Hit somersaults without the net<br>
But this'll be the year that we won't forget<br>
The 1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes<br>
Be what you wanna be as long as you know<br>
Consequences are given for livin'<br>
The fence is too high to jump in jail<br>
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!<br>
Get a life, now they on sale<br>
Then I might cast you a spell<br>
Look at what came in the mail<br>
A scale and some Arm & Hammer<br>
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama<br>
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers<br>
Stack of questions with no answers<br>
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS<br>
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days<br>
Get back home, things are wrong<br>
Well not really, it was bad all along<br>
Before you left adds up to a ball of power<br>
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour<br>
Hello, ghetto, let yo' brain breathe<br>
Believe there's always mo', ow!<br>
<br>
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Yeah, ha, ha, yeah)<br>
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Yeah, oh-ah)<br>
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ha, ha, ha, yeah)<br>
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
<br>
Uno, dos, tres, it's on<br>
Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?<br>
Like that there, boy, and will still stay street<br>
Big things happen every time we meet<br>
Like a track team, crack fiend dyin' to geek<br>
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street<br>
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep<br>
75 MC's freestylin' to the beat<br>
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club<br>
Shoulda bought an ounce, but you copped a dub<br>
Shoulda held back, but you throwed a punch<br>
'Posed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch<br>
No D to the U to the G for you<br>
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo<br>
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan<br>
Never turned my back on my kids, for them<br>
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top<br>
Before you re-up, get a laptop<br>
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals<br>
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal<br>
Record number four, but we on a roll<br>
Hold up, slow up, stop, "Control"<br>
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya<br>
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida<br>
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors<br>
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order<br>
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter<br>
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border<br>
Pitty-pat rappers tryna get to five<br>
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive<br>
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide<br>
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha-ha!<br>
<br>
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ah, yeah)<br>
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Ah, yeah)<br>
Don't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah! (Y'all over, yeah)<br>
Don't even bang unless you plan to hit something<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
Bombs over Baghdad, yeah!<br>
